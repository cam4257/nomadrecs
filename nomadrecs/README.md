Nomadrecs is a webapp build using python, html, css, javascript, and sql. 
It's purpose is to allow digital nomads or other travelers to track their travels, as well as find recommendations from other travelers. 

It is run using flask, and can be run locally by navigating to the nomadrecs folder, and in terminal entering flask run.
It is also currently running on an AWS EC2 instance using Gunicorn. It is accessible at http://nomadrecs.com:8000, or 52.20.139.244:8000. I will check this regularly to ensure it remains running and accessible during the grading period, but cannot guarantee stability. If you have trouble accessing it, please reach out via Email.

The code is available at https://github.com/cam4257/nomadrecs.git
